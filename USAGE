=== USAGE ===

Copy into a data subfolder, e.g.:

$odtHome/data/channelFlow/post/

I assume there are ODT runs denoted as "case1", "case2" etc. as:

$odtHome/data/channelFlow/case1 $odtHome/data/channelFlow/case2

Each of these directories has subdirectories input/ and data/data_00000/
containing the odt_input.yaml and model output, respectively. From
within the repo $odtHome/data/chanelFlow/post, then call:

python3 plotEddyStats.py ../case1 0    # and likewise for case2

There are optional arguments controlling the first eddy and the number
of bins. The call for the 2D plot is similar.
